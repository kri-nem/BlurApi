# BlurApi
An ASP.NET Core Web API for blurring images and encoding them to JPEG or
PNG. Decoding, blurring and encoding of the image is implemented in C++
using OpenCV library.   

I created this project as part of a job application. Although it is my first
C# project, it was quite surprising how similar it is to Java & C++.

# Documentation
The code has XML documentation in code. The API is documented with OpenAPI.
The easiest way of getting familiar with it is building and running the
project. SwaggerUI is turned on by default, and documents the API extensively.
